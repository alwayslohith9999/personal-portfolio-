        <h2>Lohith</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! I’m Lohith, currently pursuing my BTech in my 2nd year at SRM AP University. Life as a student here is a mix of academic challenges and creative exploration, and I’ve found my passion in the art of video editing. It’s not just a hobby for me—it’s something I truly enjoy because it allows me to transform raw footage into stories that evoke emotions, whether it’s a short film, a montage, or even experimental edits. I love playing around with different transitions, effects, and soundtracks to create something unique every time. There's something incredibly satisfying about seeing a project come to life after hours of tweaking and perfecting the details.

Movies are another huge part of my life. I’m a massive movie lover, and I enjoy everything from commercial blockbusters to indie films. Whether it’s action-packed thrillers, emotional dramas, mind-bending sci-fi, or lighthearted rom-coms, I appreciate the art of storytelling in all its forms. I often find myself analyzing the cinematography, direction, and even the smallest details like background scores and lighting techniques. Watching films isn’t just entertainment for me; it’s an inspiration and a way to understand different cultures, perspectives, and human emotions.

Music is like the heartbeat of my day. I listen to music all the time—whether I’m studying, relaxing, commuting, or editing videos, there’s always a playlist running in the background. My taste in music is pretty diverse, and I love discovering new artists and genres. Music fuels my creativity and helps me focus, and sometimes the right song can even inspire an entire video concept or help me get through a tough day.

Apart from movies and music, I have a soft spot for reading, especially philosophical books and love stories. Philosophical books challenge me to think deeply about life, existence, and the world around me. They give me a new perspective on things, sparking introspection and sometimes even influencing my creative projects. On the other hand, love stories tug at my heartstrings and remind me of the beauty and complexity of human relationships. Whether it’s a classic romance or a modern tale of love and heartbreak, I find these stories incredibly engaging and emotionally fulfilling.

Altogether, these interests—video editing, movies, music, and books—shape who I am. They keep me curious, constantly learning, and motivated to explore new creative avenues. Life as a student might be hectic at times, but having these passions makes every day exciting and meaningful.
